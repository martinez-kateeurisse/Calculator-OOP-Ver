# Simple App Calculator (OOP Version)

## Main Program Instructions
1. The application will ask the user to choose one of the four math operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division)
2. The application will ask the user for two numbers
3. Display the result
4. The application will ask if the user wants to try again or not.
5. If yes, repeat Step 1.
6. If no, Display “Thank you!” and the program will exit 
7. Use Python Function and appropriate Exceptions to capture errors during runtime.

## Program Execution
* This program is done in an object oriented programming way, thus, various class files are included.
* Class files are grouped based on their functionalities.
* In order to execute the calculator program, you have to run the main file named "main_calculator". 

## Repository Files Instructions
* Class files to be used when running the main calculator program include: calculation_file, exeption_file, loop_condition, prog_design, user_interface, and main_calculator.
* Other files such as: tk_methods, calc_bg ,and calculator_execution may be used when modifying the program through tkinter execution. Codes are not yet fully functional, but may still be modified (when I get more time).
* The procedural version of the program executed through tkinter is also uploaded for reference. (procedural_ver)
