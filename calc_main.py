#Kate Eurisse Martinez_BSCPE 1-5_Simple App Calculator - OOP Version

#This program will create a Simple App Calculator; where the user will input the operation as well as the two numbers that they want to calculate.
#The program will use exception handling (try-catch method) to handle user input errors.
#The program will be executed in an Object oriented programming way 

#Import class files
from user_interface import UserInterface

#Initialize variable
ui = UserInterface

#Ask the user to choose one of the four math operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division)

#Ask the user for two numbers
#Display the result
#Ask if the user wants to try again or not.
#If yes, repeat Step 1.
#If no, Display “Thank you!” and the program will exit 
#Use Python Function and appropriate Exceptions to capture errors during runtime.
